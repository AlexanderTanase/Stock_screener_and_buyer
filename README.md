<H2>Stock screener using a momentum strategy</H2>
The data used can be found in the repository under nasdaq_screener.csv or at <link>https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener</link>. Just click nasdaq from the options on the side then download csv. 
The api used is the sandbox api from IEX cloud. It is a free api, the only caveat is that the sandbox api uses manipulated data. You can sign up at <link> https://iexcloud.io/core-data/</link>.

<H2>Automated stock purchacing through alpaca</H2>
The other part of the code is taking the csv file from the screener file and creating purchace orders through alpaca. This is done through paper trading not with actual money as this is just a project to get a better understanding of what goes into making and deploying a trading model. The link to alpaca which is the broker I submited the trades to is <link>https://alpaca.markets/</link>
